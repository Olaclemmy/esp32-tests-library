# esp32-tests-library
This library is based on https://github.com/nkolban/esp32-snippets library and is build to provide test it.
In this library we can find examples how to use BLE range of functionalities, usualy updated to last version of library but when library will grow up it might happen some of them will not work. 
If there is some functionality you want me to test or something is broken in test example just raise issue.
